A Game: Pico, Fermi, Bagel

Today we will look at the logic that underlies the game "Pico, Fermi, Bagel".

How to Play:
The the game begins with one person secretly choosing a number with no repeated digits.
We will start with a three digit number. Then others attempt to guess the number, and
the one who chose the number responds to each guess as follows:

• If the guess has no numbers correct, they respond: "Bagel."

• For each digit the guess has correct, but in the wrong place, they respond: "Pico."

• For each digit the guess has correct and in the correct place, they respond: "Fermi."

As an example, lets say that you thought of the secret number 489.

Guess 1: 362 Bagel — no digit is correct.

Guess 2: 820 1 Pico — the 8 is in the wrong place.

Guess 3: 418 1 Pico, 1 Fermi — the 8 is in the wrong place, the 4 is in the correct place.

Guess 4: 518 1 Pico — the 8 is in the wrong place.

Guess 5: 487 2 Fermi — the 4 and 8 are in the correct place.

Guess 6: 489 You won! — all digits are in the correct place.
